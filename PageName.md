# Notes #


a list of old notes on the earlier analyses:
  * Hungary deleted because only method 1 and 2 implemented
  * Luxembourgh deleted because only method 1 implemented
  * In Italy people were asked all questions??? Some answered both method 2 and 3???
  * It might be an idea to also look at proportion of item-missing of method 2 compared to method 3.
  * The # people participating in the experiments differs a lot across the countries. Variance of the estimates and power differ.
  * The number 66 was not coded missing on the trust questions in some countries.
  * Sweden has nonrespondents in the dataset with all values missing.
  * High correlations in Greece, Austria, Portugal
  * Correlation TRSTLGL-TRSTLGL3 in Norway is low (0.553)


Portugal doctors experiment wrong formulation: "rarely" is missing from the translation so the sentences mean something completely different

Classic MTMM model w/ Mplus unstandardised. Equate across
countries and look for differences. For those countries +
an extreme other one (not scandinavian) go on w/ thresholds.

start with pol trust? or doctors.

write about portugal.



  1. Greece: 1 person has score 15 for SPLTADMA
  1. Ireland, Netherlands, Italy administered SB Self-completion rather than F2F
  1. IS missing SB questions TESTA28-40
  1. France did all, inc. SC AND FF.
  1. The women experiment was not done correctly in Portugal:
> > The i8-10 questions were asked identically to the main questionnaire rather than
> > as reversed items as stipulated in the source supplementary questionnaire.
> > Also the source supplementary shows single questions whereas PT used a battery.
  1. None of the self-completion questionnaires include a Don't Know option, while some of the F2F versions of the same questions do. France may provide an oppurtunity to investigate the effect this has.
