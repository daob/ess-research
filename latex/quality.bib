  abstract = {Abstract This paper is concerned with the study of similarities and
	differences in factor structures between different groups. A common
	situation occurs when a battery of tests has been administered to
	samples of examinees from several populations.A very general model
	is presented, in which any parameter in the factor analysis models
	(factor loadings, factor variances, factor covariances, and unique
	variances) for the different groups may be assigned an arbitrary
	value or constrained to be equal to some other parameter. Given such
	a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood
	method yielding a large samplex 2 of goodness of fit. By computing
	several solutions under different specifications one can test various
	hypotheses.The method is capable of dealing with any degree of invariance,
	from the one extreme, where nothing is invariant, to the other extreme,
	where everything is invariant. Neither the number of tests nor the
	number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but
	to be at all interesting, it is assumed that there is a common core
	of tests in each battery that is the same or at least content-wise
	comparable.},

  note = {The paper is concerned with the consequences for maximum likelihood

	with only a few scale steps, which are assigned integer values. It
	is hypothesized that the observed variables are obtained through
	a classification of some true variables, which are multivariate normal
	and for which a factor model holds. Using simple formulas for the
	relations between true correlations and correlations based on the
	classified variables, we demonstrate numerically the relationships
	between true factor models and results obtained from classified data.
	This is done for several choices of thresholds, true factor loadings
	and numbers of variables, assuming a one-factor model. The results
	indicate that classification may lead to a substantial lack of fit
	of the model, i.e. an erroneous indication that more factors are
	needed. This is especially true if the variables are skewed in opposite
	direction and have high true loadings, but does not depend much on

	This paper aims to present a new measurement procedure, the letter

	modalities traditionally used in attitudinal research, especially
	the ordinal categorical scales. This paper analyzes the error composition
	of the scores obtained with this new measurement procedure. The validity
	of the procedure is also analyzed and the observed variance is assessed
	to determine which part of the observed variance is ldquovalidrdquo,
	which part is random error (attenuating relationships) and which
	is correlated error (magnifying relationships). Structural equation
	models will be used to provide estimates of the measurement quality:
	(i) Reliability, (ii) Construct validity, method effect and residual
	variance. In addition, this letter scale is evaluated under another
	different perspective, Information Theory measures are also used
	to assess the amount of information transmitted. The relative merits
	of this new measurement procedure as opposed to other common response
	modalities will be discussed in both cases.},

  abstract = {Two distinctly different quantitative approaches are used to evaluate
	measurement instruments: the split-ballot experiment and the multitrait-multimethod
	(MTMM) approach. The first approach is typically used to indicate
	whether variation in the method causes differences in the response
	distribution; the second approach evaluates the reliability and validity
	of different methods. The new approach, suggested in this paper,
	combines the more attractive features of both methods. The strength
	of the split-ballot experiment is its use of independent random samples
	from the same population to provide information about differences
	in response distributions. This is also possible with the new approach,
	but this approach provides more detailed information about the reasons
	for the differences. The MTMM approach provides information about
	reliability and validity on the basis of repeated observation of
	the same traits using different methods. This information is also
	provided by the new design. The difference is that the new approach
	reduces the need for repeated observations of the same trait. Each
	sample is provided with a different combination of only two methods
	and the complete model with all methods is estimated as a multiple-group
	model. This reduces the burden for respondents and also reduces memory
	and order effects. Alternative designs and estimation methods are
	discussed, their efficiency is analyzed, and illustrations are provided.},
