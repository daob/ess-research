   The main point here is that the distances are equal.

7. Added a longish explanation of the differences between the models in assumptions.

8. Added cursory explanation of the procedure used to arrive at the final model.

9. Added a paragraph giving an intuitive example of what thresholds mean.

quality coefficients as just as important (or more)
