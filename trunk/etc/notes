-------------------------------------

Portugal doctors experiment wrong formulation:
	"rarely" is missing from the translation so the
	sentences mean something completely different


---------

Classic MTMM model w/ Mplus unstandardised. Equate across
countries and look for differences. For those countries +
an extreme other one (not scandinavian) go on w/ thresholds.

start with pol trust? or doctors. 

write about portugal.

----------------

1. Greece: 1 person has score 15 for SPLTADMA
2. Ireland, Netherlands, Italy administered SB Self-completion rather than F2F
3. IS missing SB questions TESTA28-40
4. France did all, inc. SC AND FF.
5. The women experiment was not done correctly in Portugal:
	The i8-10 questions were asked identically to the main questionnaire rather than
	as reversed items as stipulated in the source supplementary questionnaire.
	Also the source supplementary shows single questions whereas PT used a battery.
6. None of the self-completion questionnaires include a Don't Know option, while some of the 
	F2F versions of the same questions do. France may provide an oppurtunity to investigate 
	the effect this has.
---

1. Simple model 1 group no SB free MTMM model equal thresholds --> MI's
2. Equality tests in complexity and time: also constrain var(M) and var(E) but not var(T). 
3. Write about significance across countries of main questionnaire rel val and qual. produce ordering of countries in table
4. join different pieces, change intro
