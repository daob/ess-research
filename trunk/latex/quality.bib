  abstract = {Abstract This paper is concerned with the study of similarities and
	differences in factor structures between different groups. A common
	situation occurs when a battery of tests has been administered to
	samples of examinees from several populations.A very general model
	is presented, in which any parameter in the factor analysis models
	(factor loadings, factor variances, factor covariances, and unique
	variances) for the different groups may be assigned an arbitrary
	value or constrained to be equal to some other parameter. Given such
	a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood
	method yielding a large samplex 2 of goodness of fit. By computing
	several solutions under different specifications one can test various
	hypotheses.The method is capable of dealing with any degree of invariance,
	from the one extreme, where nothing is invariant, to the other extreme,
	where everything is invariant. Neither the number of tests nor the
	number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but
	to be at all interesting, it is assumed that there is a common core
	of tests in each battery that is the same or at least content-wise
	comparable.},

	This paper aims to present a new measurement procedure, the letter

	modalities traditionally used in attitudinal research, especially
	the ordinal categorical scales. This paper analyzes the error composition
	of the scores obtained with this new measurement procedure. The validity

	to determine which part of the observed variance is ldquovalidrdquo,
	which part is random error (attenuating relationships) and which
	is correlated error (magnifying relationships). Structural equation
	models will be used to provide estimates of the measurement quality:
	(i) Reliability, (ii) Construct validity, method effect and residual
	variance. In addition, this letter scale is evaluated under another
	different perspective, Information Theory measures are also used
	to assess the amount of information transmitted. The relative merits
	of this new measurement procedure as opposed to other common response
	modalities will be discussed in both cases.},

	measurement instruments: the split-ballot experiment and the multitrait-multimethod
	(MTMM) approach. The first approach is typically used to indicate
	whether variation in the method causes differences in the response
	distribution; the second approach evaluates the reliability and validity
	of different methods. The new approach, suggested in this paper,
	combines the more attractive features of both methods. The strength
	of the split-ballot experiment is its use of independent random samples
	from the same population to provide information about differences
	in response distributions. This is also possible with the new approach,
	but this approach provides more detailed information about the reasons
	for the differences. The MTMM approach provides information about
	reliability and validity on the basis of repeated observation of
	the same traits using different methods. This information is also
	provided by the new design. The difference is that the new approach
	reduces the need for repeated observations of the same trait. Each
	sample is provided with a different combination of only two methods
	and the complete model with all methods is estimated as a multiple-group
	model. This reduces the burden for respondents and also reduces memory
	and order effects. Alternative designs and estimation methods are
	discussed, their efficiency is analyzed, and illustrations are provided.},

	abstract = {In structural equation modeling the statistician needs assumptions inorder (1) to guarantee that the estimates are consistent for the parameters of interest, and (2) to evaluate precision of the estimates and significance level of test statistics. With respect to purpose (1), the typical type of analyses (ML and WLS) are robust against violation of distributional assumptions; i.e., estimates remain consistent or any type of WLS analysis and distribution of z. (It should be noted, however, that (1) is sensitive to structural misspecification.) A typical assumption used for purpose (2), is the assumption that the vector z of observable follows a multivariate normal distribution.},
