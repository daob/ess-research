	abstract = {Abstract  This paper is concerned with the study of similarities and differences in factor structures between different groups. A common situation occurs when a battery of tests has been administered to samples of examinees from several populations.A very general model is presented, in which any parameter in the factor analysis models (factor loadings, factor variances, factor covariances, and unique variances) for the different groups may be assigned an arbitrary value or constrained to be equal to some other parameter. Given such a specification, the model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method yielding a large samplex 2 of goodness of fit. By computing several solutions under different specifications one can test various hypotheses.The method is capable of dealing with any degree of invariance, from the one extreme, where nothing is invariant, to the other extreme, where everything is invariant. Neither the number of tests nor the number of common factors need to be the same for all groups, but to be at all interesting, it is assumed that there is a common core of tests in each battery that is the same or at least content-wise comparable.},

	abstract = {Since measurement errors have strong effects in all relationships (statistical or otherwise) studied, there is an increasing interest in the data quality, which is the major justification for this research.
This paper aims to present a new measurement procedure, the letter scale, which avoids many of the problems connected with the response modalities traditionally used in attitudinal research, especially the ordinal categorical scales.
This paper analyzes the error composition of the scores obtained with this new measurement procedure. The validity of the procedure is also analyzed and the observed variance is assessed to determine which part of the observed variance is ldquovalidrdquo, which part is random error (attenuating relationships) and which is correlated error (magnifying relationships). Structural equation models will be used to provide estimates of the measurement quality: (i) Reliability, (ii) Construct validity, method effect and residual variance.
In addition, this letter scale is evaluated under another different perspective, Information Theory measures are also used to assess the amount of information transmitted.
The relative merits of this new measurement procedure as opposed to other common response modalities will be discussed in both cases.},

It is hypothesized that the observed variables are obtained through a classification of some true variables, which are multivariate normal and for which a factor model holds. Using simple formulas for the relations between true correlations and correlations based on the classified variables, we demonstrate numerically the relationships between true factor models and results obtained from classified data. This is done for several choices of thresholds, true factor loadings and numbers of variables, assuming a one-factor model. The results indicate that classification may lead to a substantial lack of fit of the model, i.e. an erroneous indication that more factors are needed. This is especially true if the variables are skewed in opposite direction and have high true loadings, but does not depend much on th...}

	abstract = {Two distinctly different quantitative approaches are used to evaluate measurement instruments: the split-ballot experiment and the multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) approach. The first approach is typically used to indicate whether variation in the method causes differences in the response distribution; the second approach evaluates the reliability and validity of different methods. The new approach, suggested in this paper, combines the more attractive features of both methods. The strength of the split-ballot experiment is its use of independent random samples from the same population to provide information about differences in response distributions. This is also possible with the new approach, but this approach provides more detailed information about the reasons for the differences. The MTMM approach provides information about reliability and validity on the basis of repeated observation of the same traits using different methods. This information is also provided by the new design. The difference is that the new approach reduces the need for repeated observations of the same trait. Each sample is provided with a different combination of only two methods and the complete model with all methods is estimated as a multiple-group model. This reduces the burden for respondents and also reduces memory and order effects. Alternative designs and estimation methods are discussed, their efficiency is analyzed, and illustrations are provided.},
